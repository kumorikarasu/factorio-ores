# factorio-ores

Creation of new ores, hopefully we will have some form of standard ore libraries so we don't have a ton of indivual ones.

### Gold

Adds gold as a new resource, this will mostly be used in circuit production.

### Sandstone

This is the primary source of sand, which will be used in both military and assembly lines.

### Clay

Clay is a required early game resource used in smelting and other heat related components
